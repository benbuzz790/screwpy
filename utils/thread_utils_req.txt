## Purpose
Provide utilities for thread specification parsing, validation, and calculations.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All dimensional calculations must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must be unit-agnostic in implementation
4. Must handle thread specifications as strings with integer pitch diameters

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must provide thread specification parsing

3. Must calculate thread dimensions

## Specific Requirements

### Thread Specification Parsing
1. Must parse standard thread specifications:
   - UNC (Unified National Coarse)
   - UNF (Unified National Fine)
   - Format examples: "1/4-20 UNC", "3/8-16 UNC", "1/4-28 UNF"
2. Must extract from specification string:
   - Nominal diameter
   - Threads per inch
   - Thread series
3. Must validate specification format

### Thread Calculations
1. Must calculate with proper units:
   - Pitch diameter
   - Minor diameter
   - Major diameter
   - Thread pitch
2. Must support standard thread series calculations:
   - UNC series dimensions
   - UNF series dimensions
3. Must handle both fractional and decimal inputs

### Thread Validation
1. Must validate:
   - Thread specification format
   - Thread series compatibility
   - Dimensional consistency
   - Unit compatibility
2. Must provide thread matching validation between components

### Required Functions
1. Thread Parsing:
   - parse_thread_specification(spec: str) -> ThreadInfo
   - validate_thread_format(spec: str) -> bool
   - extract_thread_dimensions(spec: str) -> Dict[str, Quantity]

2. Thread Calculations:
   - calculate_pitch_diameter(spec: str) -> Quantity
   - calculate_minor_diameter(spec: str) -> Quantity
   - calculate_thread_pitch(spec: str) -> Quantity

3. Thread Validation:
   - is_valid_thread_spec(spec: str) -> bool
   - are_threads_compatible(spec1: str, spec2: str) -> bool
   - validate_thread_series(spec: str) -> bool

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All function parameters
   - All return values
   - Custom types (ThreadInfo, etc.)
2. Must properly type hint:
   - Pint quantities
   - Thread specifications
   - Return types

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - Each function
   - Each custom type
   - Constants and lookup tables
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must document:
   - Supported thread series
   - Thread specification format
   - Unit handling
   - Calculation methods

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Thread specification parsing
   - Dimension calculations
   - Validation functions
   - Error conditions
4. Must test with:
   - Various thread specifications
   - Both imperial and metric units
   - Invalid specifications
   - Edge cases
   - Different thread series

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid thread specifications
   - Unsupported thread series
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Calculation errors
   - Validation failures

### Constants and Data
1. Must maintain thread series data:
   - Standard UNC specifications
   - Standard UNF specifications
   - Thread formulas
   - Conversion factors

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
   - re (for string parsing)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)

### Implementation Notes
1. Must use regular expressions for parsing
2. Must maintain clear separation of concerns
3. Must provide reusable utilities
4. Must support future thread series additions
5. Must handle common thread specification formats
6. Must provide clear error messages
