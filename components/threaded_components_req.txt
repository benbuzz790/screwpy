# Requirements for threaded_components.py

## Purpose
Implement concrete classes for threaded components (Fastener and Nut) in fastener assemblies.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All dimensional values must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must be unit-agnostic in implementation
4. Thread specifications must be strings with integer pitch diameters

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must implement ThreadedComponent subclasses:
   - Fastener
   - Nut
2. Must integrate with material system
3. Must support thread specifications

## Specific Requirements

### Class Hierarchy
1. Must inherit from BaseComponent
2. Must implement ThreadedComponent abstract class
3. Must implement all abstract methods from parent classes

### ThreadedComponent Abstract Class
1. Required properties with units:
   - Thread specification (string)
   - Pitch diameter (length units)
   - Threaded section length (length units)
   - Material reference
2. Common validation requirements:
   - Valid thread specification format
   - Positive dimensions
   - Valid material reference

### Fastener Class
1. Required properties with units:
   - Length (length units)
   - Head diameter (length units)
   - Head height (length units)
   - All ThreadedComponent properties
2. Required non-unit properties:
   - Type (Flat/Not flat boolean)
   - Tool size (string)
3. Validation requirements:
   - Head diameter > pitch diameter
   - Length > threaded length
   - All dimensions positive
   - Valid tool size specification

### Nut Class
1. Required properties:
   - All ThreadedComponent properties
2. Additional properties with units:
   - Width across flats (length units)
   - Height (length units)
3. Validation requirements:
   - Width across flats > pitch diameter
   - All dimensions positive

### Common Requirements
1. Property access methods:
   - Getters and setters for all properties
   - Material property access
2. Unit conversion support:
   - Convert between metric and imperial
   - Maintain unit consistency
3. Thread specification handling:
   - Parse thread specifications
   - Calculate/store pitch diameters
   - Support standard thread series (UNC, UNF)

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All method parameters
   - All return values
   - All property definitions
2. Must properly type hint pint quantities
3. Must properly type hint thread specifications

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - Each class
   - Each method
   - Each property
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must include unit specification in property documentation
4. Must document thread specification format

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Component creation
   - Property access and modification
   - Unit conversions
   - Thread specification parsing
   - Validation logic
   - Error conditions
4. Must include examples with both imperial and metric units
5. Must test integration with material system
6. Must test various thread specifications

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid dimensions
   - Invalid thread specifications
   - Invalid material assignments
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Validation failures

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)
   - materials.material (for material type hints)
   - components.base_component (for base class)
   - utils.thread_utils (for thread specification handling)
