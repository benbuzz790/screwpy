# Requirements for clamped_components.py

## Purpose
Implement concrete classes for clamped components (Washer and PlateComponent) in fastener assemblies.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All dimensional values must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must be unit-agnostic in implementation

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must implement ClampedComponent subclasses:
   - Washer
   - PlateComponent
2. Must integrate with material system
3. Must support basic geometric validation

## Specific Requirements

### Class Hierarchy
1. Must inherit from BaseComponent
2. Must implement all abstract methods from parent

### Washer Class
1. Required properties with units:
   - Inner diameter (length units)
   - Outer diameter (length units)
   - Thickness (length units)
   - Material reference
2. Validation requirements:
   - Outer diameter must be greater than inner diameter
   - All dimensions must be positive
   - Must have valid material reference

### PlateComponent Class
1. Required properties with units:
   - Thickness (length units)
   - Material reference
2. Validation requirements:
   - Thickness must be positive
   - Must have valid material reference

### Common Requirements
1. Property access methods:
   - Getters and setters for all dimensional properties
   - Material property access
2. Unit conversion support:
   - Convert between metric and imperial
   - Maintain unit consistency

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All method parameters
   - All return values
   - All property definitions
2. Must properly type hint pint quantities

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - Each class
   - Each method
   - Each property
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must include unit specification in property documentation

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Component creation
   - Property access and modification
   - Unit conversions
   - Validation logic
   - Error conditions
4. Must include examples with both imperial and metric units
5. Must test integration with material system

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid dimensions
   - Invalid material assignments
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Validation failures

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)
   - materials.material (for material type hints)
   - components.base_component (for base class)
