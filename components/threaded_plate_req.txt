# Requirements for threaded_plate.py

## Purpose
Implement the ThreadedPlate class that combines characteristics of both clamped and threaded components.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All dimensional values must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must be unit-agnostic in implementation
4. Thread specifications must be strings with integer pitch diameters

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must implement ThreadedPlate class combining:
   - ClampedComponent characteristics
   - ThreadedComponent characteristics
2. Must integrate with material system
3. Must support both clamped and threaded interfaces

## Specific Requirements

### Class Hierarchy
1. Must inherit from both:
   - ClampedComponent
   - ThreadedComponent
2. Must implement all abstract methods from both parent classes
3. Must resolve any method conflicts between parent classes

### ThreadedPlate Class
1. Required properties from ClampedComponent:
   - Thickness (length units)
   - Material reference

2. Required properties from ThreadedComponent:
   - Thread specification (string)
   - Pitch diameter (length units)
   - Threaded section length (length units)

3. Additional required properties:
   - Thread location coordinates (if needed for future expansion)
   - Clearance hole diameter (length units)

4. Validation requirements:
   - All dimensions must be positive
   - Valid thread specification format
   - Valid material reference
   - Threaded length must not exceed plate thickness
   - Clearance hole diameter must be greater than pitch diameter
   - Thread location must be valid within plate geometry

### Property Management
1. Must properly handle property inheritance from both parent classes
2. Must provide unified interface for accessing all properties
3. Must maintain unit consistency across all properties

### Common Requirements
1. Property access methods:
   - Getters and setters for all properties
   - Material property access
2. Unit conversion support:
   - Convert between metric and imperial
   - Maintain unit consistency
3. Thread specification handling:
   - Parse thread specifications
   - Calculate/store pitch diameters
   - Support standard thread series

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All method parameters
   - All return values
   - All property definitions
2. Must properly type hint pint quantities
3. Must properly type hint thread specifications

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - The class
   - Each method
   - Each property
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must include unit specification in property documentation
4. Must document thread specification format
5. Must document multiple inheritance structure

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Component creation
   - Property access and modification
   - Unit conversions
   - Thread specification handling
   - Validation logic
   - Error conditions
   - Multiple inheritance functionality
4. Must include examples with both imperial and metric units
5. Must test integration with material system
6. Must test various thread specifications

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid dimensions
   - Invalid thread specifications
   - Invalid material assignments
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Validation failures
   - Invalid thread locations

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)
   - materials.material (for material type hints)
   - components.base_component (for base class)
   - components.clamped_components (for ClampedComponent)
   - components.threaded_components (for ThreadedComponent)
   - utils.thread_utils (for thread specification handling)
