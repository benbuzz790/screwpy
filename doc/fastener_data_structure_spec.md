# Fastener Analysis Library Technical Specification
Version 1.0

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background
Engineering calculations for fastener assemblies require careful consideration of materials, geometry, and loading conditions. Current solutions often:
- Lack proper unit handling, leading to calculation errors
- Don't provide a clear object-oriented structure for assembly representation
- Mix data structures with analysis logic

This library will provide a foundation for fastener analysis by:
- Implementing robust data structures with built-in unit handling
- Separating component representation from analysis logic
- Supporting both standard and custom fastener configurations

### 1.2 Design Principles
0. "LLM - implementable"
1. KISS: Keep solutions simple and focused
2. YAGNI: Only implement proven necessary features
3. SOLID: Design modular, maintainable components
4. flat: All program files shall be in a single directory
5. Units Required: All parameters must include units using pint library
6. Data-First: Focus on data structures before analysis implementation

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Input Requirements
- All dimensional inputs must include units
- Material properties must include appropriate units
- Thread specifications must be provided as strings (e.g., "1/4-20 UNC")
- Imperial units preferred but system should be unit-agnostic
- JSON support for future component loading

- Unit tests for material property access
- Validation of unit handling
- Basic assembly creation tests

## 7. Security Requirements
None specified (YAGNI)

## 8. Development Guidelines

### 8.1 Code Quality
- All properties must include units - use pint
- Clear separation between data structures and future analysis
- Type hints required for all methods
- Documentation strings required for all classes

### 8.2 Documentation
- Class and method documentation
- Usage examples
- Unit handling examples

## 9. Future Considerations
Features **intentionally deferred**:
1. Analysis module (NASA 5020 compliance)
2. Component loading from specifications/files
3. Visualization capabilities
4. Advanced thread validation
5. Additional material definitions
6. Assembly validation logic


## 10. Definition of Done
Project is complete when:
1. All core data structures are implemented with unit support
2. Generic steel and aluminum materials are defined
3. Basic junction assembly is demonstrated
4. Unit tests pass
5. A full system demonstration

## 11. Special Instructions
- Maintain strict separation between data structures and future analysis logic
- Ensure all numerical values include appropriate units using pint
- Keep thread specifications as strings AND integer pitch diameters
