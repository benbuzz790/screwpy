# Requirements for base_component.py

## Purpose
Provide abstract base classes that define the core structure for all fastener assembly components.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All numerical properties must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must provide unit-agnostic interfaces

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must define BaseComponent abstract base class
2. Must define interfaces for material property access
3. Must support component hierarchy through inheritance

## Specific Requirements

### BaseComponent Class
1. Must be an abstract base class
2. Must define interface for:
   - Material property access
   - Component identification
   - Basic geometric properties
   - Unit conversion utilities

### Properties
1. Required properties with units:
   - Material reference (no units, but provides unit-based properties)
   - Any geometric dimensions must use length units

### Methods
1. Must include abstract methods for:
   - Material property access
   - Basic geometric validation
   - Unit conversion support
2. Must include concrete methods for:
   - Common unit conversions
   - Basic property validation

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All method parameters
   - All return values
   - All property definitions
2. Must properly type hint pint quantities

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - Each class
   - Each method
   - Each property
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must include unit specification in property documentation

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Class instantiation
   - Property access
   - Unit conversions
   - Validation methods
   - Error conditions
4. Must include examples of both imperial and metric unit usage

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid material assignments
   - Invalid property values
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Validation failures

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - abc (for abstract base class)
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)
   - materials.material (for material type hints)
