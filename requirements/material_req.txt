# Requirements for material.py

## Purpose
Define the base Material class that provides the foundation for all material definitions in the system.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All material properties must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must be unit-agnostic in implementation
4. Must handle unit conversions for all properties

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must implement Material class with all required properties
2. Must support standard material property access and modification
3. Must support instantiation with material name/specification

## Specific Requirements

### Material Class
   - Name/specification (string)
1. Required Material Properties (all with appropriate units):
   - Yield strength (stress units)
   - Ultimate strength (stress units)
   - Density (mass/volume units)
   - Poisson's ratio (dimensionless)
   - Modulus of elasticity (stress units)
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion (1/temperature units)

2. Required Methods:
   - Property getters and setters
   - Unit conversion utilities
   - Property validation
   - Property initialization

### Property Requirements
1. All properties must:
   - Have appropriate units
   - Be positive values (where applicable)
   - Support unit conversion
   - Have proper validation
   - Be properly documented

2. Specific Property Constraints:
   - Yield strength must be less than ultimate strength
   - Poisson's ratio must be between 0 and 0.5
   - All strength values must be positive
   - Density must be positive
   - Modulus must be positive
   - Thermal expansion coefficient must be positive

### Unit Handling
1. Must support standard unit types:
   - Stress (Pa, psi)
   - Density (kg/m³, lb/in³)
   - Temperature (K, °C, °F)
2. Must provide unit conversion methods
3. Must validate unit types on assignment
4. Must maintain unit consistency

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All method parameters
   - All return values
   - All property definitions
2. Must properly type hint pint quantities
3. Must properly type hint optional values

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - The class
   - Each method
   - Each property
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must include unit specifications in documentation
4. Must document valid ranges for properties

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Material creation
   - Property access and modification
   - Unit conversions
   - Validation logic
   - Error conditions
4. Must test with:
   - Both imperial and metric units
   - Edge case values
   - Invalid values
   - Unit conversion scenarios

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid property values
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Validation failures
   - Invalid unit types
   - Property constraint violations

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
   - typing (for type hints)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)

### Implementation Notes
1. Must be implemented as a concrete class that can be instantiated
2. Must enforce unit requirements on all properties
3. Must enforce name/specification requirements
4. Must include proper property decorators
5. Must support creation of standard material instances
