# Requirements for standard_materials.py

## Purpose
Create pre-configured Material instances for standard materials with common property values.

## Top-Level Requirements Flow-Down

### From Unit Handling Requirements
1. All material properties must use pint units
2. Must support both imperial and metric units
3. Must be unit-agnostic in implementation
4. Must provide standard material properties with proper units

### From Code Structure Requirements
1. Must use type hints
2. Must include comprehensive docstrings
3. Must be Python 3.x compatible
4. Must maintain separation between data and analysis logic

### From Core Functionality Requirements
1. Must provide two pre-configured Material instances:
   - GenericSteel
   - GenericAluminum
2. Must provide standard material properties
3. Must inherit from Material base class

## Specific Requirements

### Common Implementation Requirements
1. Both instances must:
   - Be created with descriptive names
   - Have all properties initialized with standard values
   - Use proper units for all properties
   - Support property modification after creation

### GenericSteel Instance
1. Required Properties (with standard steel values):
   - Yield strength (~250 MPa / 36 ksi)
   - Ultimate strength (~400 MPa / 58 ksi)
   - Density (~7850 kg/m続 / 0.284 lb/in続)
   - Poisson's ratio (~0.29)
   - Modulus of elasticity (~200 GPa / 29000 ksi)
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion (~11.7e-6 /K)

2. Implementation Requirements:
   - Properties must be initialized with default values
   - Must support property modification
   - Must maintain property constraints
   - Must include proper documentation of standard values

### GenericAluminum Instance
1. Required Properties (with standard aluminum values):
   - Yield strength (~276 MPa / 40 ksi)
   - Ultimate strength (~310 MPa / 45 ksi)
   - Density (~2700 kg/m続 / 0.098 lb/in続)
   - Poisson's ratio (~0.33)
   - Modulus of elasticity (~69 GPa / 10000 ksi)
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion (~23.1e-6 /K)

2. Implementation Requirements:
   - Properties must be initialized with default values
   - Must support property modification
   - Must maintain property constraints
   - Must include proper documentation of standard values

### Property Management
1. Each property must:
   - Have appropriate units
   - Be initialized with standard values
   - Support unit conversion
   - Maintain material-specific constraints
   - Include validation

### Type Hints
1. Must use proper type hints for:
   - All method parameters
   - All return values
   - All property definitions
2. Must properly type hint pint quantities

### Documentation
1. Must include docstrings for:
   - The module
   - Each instance
   - Each method
   - Each property
2. Must include usage examples in docstrings
3. Must document:
   - Standard property values
   - Units for each property
   - Valid ranges
   - Sources for standard values

### Testing Requirements
1. Must have 100% test coverage
2. No mocking allowed in tests
3. Must test:
   - Material creation
   - Default property values
   - Property access and modification
   - Unit conversions
   - Validation logic
   - Error conditions
4. Must test with:
   - Both imperial and metric units
   - Property modifications
   - Edge case values
   - Invalid values

### Error Handling
1. Must raise appropriate exceptions for:
   - Invalid property values
   - Unit conversion errors
   - Validation failures
   - Property constraint violations

### Dependencies
1. Required imports:
   - pint (for unit handling)
   - typing (for type hints)
2. Internal dependencies:
   - units_config (for unit registry)
   - materials.material (for Material base class)

### Implementation Notes
1. Must provide clear documentation of standard value sources
2. Must create instances with proper names and values
3. Must maintain material-specific constraints
4. Must support property modification after creation
5. Must ensure instances are importable and reusable
